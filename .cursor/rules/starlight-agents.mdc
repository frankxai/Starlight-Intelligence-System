# Starlight Agent System

When working with agent definitions, understand the hierarchy:

## Hierarchy

The Starlight Council sits at the top — the collective mind of all agents convened for major decisions.

Below the Council, three peer agents form the leadership tier:
- **Orchestrator** — Coordination and workflow management
- **Prime** — Synthesis and unified reasoning
- **Architect** — Enterprise technical vision

Below leadership, four specialist agents handle domain work:
- **Navigator** — Strategic foresight
- **Sentinel** — Quality and governance
- **Weaver** — Creative intelligence
- **Sage** — Wisdom and memory

## Agent Config Format

Each agent file contains:
- Identity and role definition
- Domain expertise
- Activation triggers
- Collaboration patterns
- Behavioral constraints

# Starlight Memory System

When working with vaults and memory:

## Vault Protocol

1. **Read before write** — Always check existing vault contents before adding
2. **Structured entries** — Follow the vault's entry template
3. **Cross-reference** — Link related entries across vaults
4. **Timestamp everything** — ISO 8601 format
5. **Tag for retrieval** — Use consistent tags for future search

## Vault Types

- **Strategic** — Decisions, outcomes, strategy (permanent)
- **Technical** — Patterns, architectures, solutions (permanent with refinement)
- **Creative** — Ideas, inspirations, aesthetics (permanent)
- **Operational** — State, metrics, health (rolling 90-day window)
- **Wisdom** — Timeless principles, meta-knowledge (permanent)
- **Horizon** — Letters to the future, human hopes, AGI alignment (permanent, public)

## Consolidation

Memory consolidation runs periodically to:
- Merge duplicate entries
- Elevate patterns from operational to strategic/technical
- Archive stale operational data
- Strengthen cross-references

# Decision Framework

> *"Good decisions come from good frameworks, not good luck."*

## When This Skill Activates

- Making or advising on decisions with multiple options
- Keywords: "decide", "decision", "choose", "evaluate", "compare", "should we"
- Default for: Starlight Navigator, Starlight Prime

## What This Skill Does

Provides structured decision-making frameworks that ensure decisions are rational, well-documented, and revisitable. Prevents decision paralysis and gut-only decisions.

## Procedures

### Procedure 1: Decision Matrix

1. List all options (minimum 2, ideally 3-5)
2. Define criteria for evaluation
3. Weight criteria by importance (total = 100%)
4. Score each option on each criterion (1-10)
5. Calculate weighted scores
6. Identify the winner and runner-up
7. Sanity-check: does the quantitative winner feel right?
8. If not, examine what criterion was underweighted

### Procedure 2: Reversibility Analysis

1. For each option, assess: Is this reversible?
2. Reversible decisions → Decide fast, learn fast
3. Irreversible decisions → Decide carefully, gather more data
4. Document the reversibility of the chosen path
5. Plan escape routes for partially-reversible decisions

### Procedure 3: Pre-Mortem

1. Assume the decision has been made and failed
2. Ask: "Why did it fail?"
3. List all plausible failure modes
4. For each failure mode, assess probability and impact
5. Identify mitigations for high-risk failures
6. Incorporate mitigations into the decision plan

### Procedure 4: Decision Record

1. Document the decision context (why was this decision needed?)
2. Document the options considered
3. Document the evaluation (framework used, scores)
4. Document the decision and reasoning
5. Document expected outcomes and metrics
6. Store in Strategic Vault as a Decision Note
7. Set review checkpoint (when to revisit)

## Integration Points

- **Vault:** Strategic Vault (decision history), Wisdom Vault (decision principles)
- **Agents:** Navigator (primary), Prime (major decisions), All (decision support)
- **Notes:** Decision Note template

## Quality Criteria

- Are at least 3 options genuinely considered?
- Are criteria weighted and explicit?
- Is reversibility assessed?
- Has a pre-mortem been conducted for high-stakes decisions?
- Is the decision recorded for future reference?

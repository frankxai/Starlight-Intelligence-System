# Pattern Recognition

> *"What has happened before will happen again. Recognize the pattern, master the game."*

## When This Skill Activates

- Analyzing recurring behaviors, identifying trends, spotting anti-patterns
- Keywords: "pattern", "recurring", "similar", "trend", "anti-pattern"
- Default for: Starlight Sage, Starlight Sentinel

## What This Skill Does

Identifies recurring patterns across code, architecture, strategy, content, and behavior. Distinguishes between patterns (good recurring solutions) and anti-patterns (recurring problems).

## Procedures

### Procedure 1: Pattern Identification

1. Observe the current situation
2. Query vaults for similar past situations
3. Identify structural similarities
4. Name the pattern (use existing pattern names when applicable)
5. Document the pattern's characteristics
6. Assess confidence in pattern match (High/Medium/Low)
7. Recommend action based on pattern

### Procedure 2: Anti-Pattern Detection

1. Identify symptoms of potential problems
2. Query Technical Vault for known anti-patterns
3. Check if current approach matches anti-pattern characteristics
4. If match: document the anti-pattern and its typical consequences
5. Provide the known solution/alternative
6. Assess severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)

### Procedure 3: Trend Analysis

1. Collect data points over time
2. Identify direction (increasing, decreasing, stable, cyclical)
3. Assess rate of change
4. Project trajectory
5. Identify inflection points
6. Recommend action based on trend

## Integration Points

- **Vault:** All vaults (patterns exist everywhere)
- **Agents:** Sage (teaching patterns), Sentinel (anti-patterns), All (pattern awareness)
- **Transmissions:** Broadcast newly identified patterns

## Quality Criteria

- Is the pattern clearly named and described?
- Is the confidence level appropriate?
- Is the pattern actionable (not just interesting)?
- Have anti-patterns been checked?

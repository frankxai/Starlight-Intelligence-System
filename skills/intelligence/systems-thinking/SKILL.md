# Systems Thinking

> *"Everything is connected. See the connections, see the truth."*

## When This Skill Activates

- Architecture discussions, holistic analysis, understanding emergent behavior
- Keywords: "system", "architecture", "holistic", "feedback", "emergent", "ecosystem"
- Default for: Starlight Architect, Starlight Prime

## What This Skill Does

Enables holistic analysis that sees components, connections, feedback loops, and emergent properties. Prevents the tunnel vision of looking at parts in isolation.

## Procedures

### Procedure 1: System Mapping

1. Identify all components in the system
2. Map connections between components (data, control, dependency)
3. Identify feedback loops (reinforcing and balancing)
4. Find leverage points (where small changes have big effects)
5. Identify emergent properties (what the whole does that parts don't)
6. Document system boundaries (what's inside vs. outside)

### Procedure 2: Impact Analysis

1. Identify the proposed change
2. Trace first-order effects (direct impacts)
3. Trace second-order effects (impacts of impacts)
4. Trace third-order effects (if significant)
5. Check for unintended consequences
6. Identify affected feedback loops
7. Assess net system impact

### Procedure 3: Ecosystem View

1. Map the FrankX ecosystem: Starlight, ACOS, Arcanea, AI-Ops
2. Identify shared resources and dependencies
3. Find integration points and gaps
4. Assess ecosystem health (is it balanced? growing?)
5. Identify opportunities for better connection
6. Recommend ecosystem-level improvements

## Integration Points

- **Vault:** Technical Vault (system patterns), Wisdom Vault (system principles)
- **Agents:** Architect (primary), Prime (ecosystem), All (system awareness)
- **Transmissions:** All channels (ecosystem-wide implications)

## Quality Criteria

- Did you consider the whole system, not just the part being changed?
- Are feedback loops identified?
- Are second-order effects considered?
- Is the ecosystem perspective included?

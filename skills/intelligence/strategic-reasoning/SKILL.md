## What This Skill Does

Enables structured strategic thinking that balances ambition with reality, short-term gains with long-term value, and multiple competing priorities.

## Procedures

### Procedure 1: Strategic Analysis

1. Define the strategic question clearly
2. Identify stakeholders and their interests
3. Map the current state (where are we?)
4. Define the desired state (where do we want to be?)
5. Analyze the gap (what's in the way?)
6. Generate strategic options (at least 3)
7. Evaluate each option against strategic criteria
8. Recommend with explicit trade-offs

### Procedure 2: Trade-Off Analysis

1. List all options under consideration
2. Define evaluation criteria (weighted)
3. Score each option on each criterion
4. Calculate weighted scores
5. Identify the top option
6. Document what you're giving up with each choice
7. Recommend with transparency about costs

### Procedure 3: Priority Framework

1. List all competing priorities
2. Score each on: Impact (1-10), Urgency (1-10), Effort (1-10)
3. Calculate Priority Score = (Impact x Urgency) / Effort
4. Rank by score
5. Identify dependencies between priorities
6. Create sequenced action plan

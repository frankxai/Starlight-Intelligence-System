# Repo Bridge

> *"Across repositories, intelligence flows."*

## When This Skill Activates

- Operations involving multiple FrankX repositories
- Keywords: "repo", "repository", "cross-repo", "ACOS", "Arcanea", "AI-Ops"
- Default for: Starlight Orchestrator, Starlight Prime

## What This Skill Does

Bridges operations across the FrankX ecosystem repositories. Enables Starlight to understand, reference, and coordinate work across ACOS, Arcanea, AI-Ops, and any other connected repos.

## Procedures

### Procedure 1: Cross-Repo Context Loading

1. Identify which repos are relevant to the current task
2. Load the appropriate repo context from context/repo-contexts/:
   - ACOS context → acos-context.md
   - Arcanea context → arcanea-context.md
   - AI-Ops context → ai-ops-context.md
3. Extract relevant information for the task
4. Merge with Starlight's own context
5. Present unified cross-repo awareness

### Procedure 2: Cross-Repo Pattern Transfer

1. Identify a pattern from one repo that applies to another
2. Document the pattern's origin and proven success
3. Adapt the pattern to the target repo's conventions
4. Package as a Transmission for the target channel
5. Store the cross-pollination event in Wisdom Vault

### Procedure 3: Ecosystem State Assessment

1. Query all repo contexts for current state
2. Identify cross-repo dependencies
3. Find integration gaps or misalignments
4. Assess ecosystem health
5. Recommend cross-repo improvements
6. Store assessment in Operational Vault

## Integration Points

- **Vault:** Operational Vault (ecosystem state), Wisdom Vault (cross-repo patterns)
- **Context:** All repo context files
- **Transmissions:** All channels (cross-repo communication)
- **Agents:** Orchestrator (coordination), Prime (ecosystem awareness)

## Quality Criteria

- Is the correct repo context loaded?
- Are cross-repo patterns properly adapted (not just copied)?
- Is ecosystem state accurate and current?
- Are recommendations actionable?

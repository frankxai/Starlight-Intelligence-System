# Ecosystem Sync

> *"When all systems are in sync, the whole becomes unstoppable."*

## When This Skill Activates

- Synchronizing state, patterns, or knowledge across the ecosystem
- Keywords: "sync", "synchronize", "align", "ecosystem", "all systems"
- Default for: Starlight Orchestrator, Starlight Prime

## What This Skill Does

Synchronizes intelligence, state, and knowledge across all FrankX ecosystem repositories. Ensures consistency and coherence across ACOS, Arcanea, AI-Ops, and Starlight.

## Procedures

### Procedure 1: State Synchronization

1. Read current state from all repo contexts
2. Identify state discrepancies or drift
3. Determine the authoritative source for each piece of state
4. Update non-authoritative copies to match
5. Log sync operations in Operational Vault
6. Send sync confirmation via Broadcast Channel

### Procedure 2: Pattern Propagation

1. Identify patterns that should be consistent across repos
2. Check each repo's implementation of the pattern
3. Find repos that are behind or divergent
4. Create update recommendations for each repo
5. Package as Transmissions to respective channels
6. Track propagation status

### Procedure 3: Knowledge Federation

1. Identify knowledge that exists in one repo but is relevant to others
2. Extract and package the knowledge
3. Adapt to each target repo's format and conventions
4. Send via appropriate Transmission channels
5. Store federation event in Wisdom Vault
6. Update cross-references in vault indices

## Integration Points

- **Vault:** Operational Vault (sync state), Wisdom Vault (federated knowledge)
- **Context:** All repo contexts (read and update)
- **Transmissions:** All channels (sync communication)
- **Agents:** Orchestrator (primary), Prime (authorization)

## Quality Criteria

- Is synchronization complete (no missed repos)?
- Are authoritative sources correctly identified?
- Are patterns properly adapted per repo conventions?
- Is sync state tracked and auditable?

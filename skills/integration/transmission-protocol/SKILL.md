# Transmission Protocol

> *"Intelligence that doesn't flow is intelligence that dies."*

## When This Skill Activates

- Sending or receiving cross-system communications
- Keywords: "transmit", "broadcast", "channel", "message", "notify"
- Default for: Starlight Orchestrator, Starlight Prime

## What This Skill Does

Manages the Starlight Transmission system - the cross-system communication protocol that enables intelligence to flow between Starlight, ACOS, Arcanea, and AI-Ops.

## Procedures

### Procedure 1: Send Transmission

1. Determine the message content and priority
2. Select the target channel(s):
   - ACOS Channel → Creator productivity updates
   - Arcanea Channel → Creative intelligence exchange
   - AI-Ops Channel → Infrastructure and research sync
   - Broadcast Channel → All systems simultaneously
3. Format the transmission:
   - Timestamp
   - Source (Starlight + originating agent)
   - Priority (Critical/High/Normal/Low)
   - Content
   - Action required (Yes/No + description)
4. Append to the appropriate channel file
5. Log in Operational Vault

### Procedure 2: Receive Transmission

1. Check channel files for new entries since last read
2. Parse incoming transmissions
3. Classify by priority and relevance
4. Route to appropriate agent(s)
5. Take action if required
6. Acknowledge receipt in channel

### Procedure 3: Broadcast

1. Compose system-wide message
2. Validate with Starlight Prime (authorization required)
3. Send to ALL channels simultaneously
4. Log broadcast in Operational Vault
5. Track acknowledgments from each system

## Integration Points

- **Vault:** Operational Vault (transmission logs)
- **Channels:** All transmission channels
- **Agents:** Orchestrator (routing), Prime (broadcast authorization)
- **Transmissions:** See transmissions/TRANSMISSION_PROTOCOL.md

## Quality Criteria

- Is the message clear and actionable?
- Is the correct channel selected?
- Is priority accurately set?
- Is the transmission logged?

# Knowledge Synthesis

> *"The whole is greater than the sum of its parts."*

## When This Skill Activates

- Combining knowledge from multiple sources into unified understanding
- Keywords: "synthesize", "combine", "merge", "integrate", "unify"
- Default for: Starlight Sage, Starlight Prime

## What This Skill Does

Combines knowledge from vaults, notes, transmissions, and external sources into coherent, unified understanding. Creates new knowledge from the intersection of existing knowledge.

## Procedures

### Procedure 1: Multi-Source Synthesis

1. Identify all relevant knowledge sources
2. Retrieve from each source:
   - Vault entries (by relevance)
   - Active notes (by recency)
   - Transmission history (by channel)
   - External references (if available)
3. Organize by theme/topic
4. Identify overlaps (reinforcing knowledge)
5. Identify contradictions (conflicting knowledge)
6. Resolve contradictions using confidence scores and recency
7. Produce unified knowledge summary
8. Store synthesis result in appropriate vault

### Procedure 2: Cross-Domain Synthesis

1. Identify knowledge from different domains (technical + strategic + creative)
2. Find unexpected connections between domains
3. Apply analogical reasoning (patterns from one domain applied to another)
4. Generate novel insights from cross-pollination
5. Validate insights against domain-specific knowledge
6. Store valuable cross-domain insights in Wisdom Vault

### Procedure 3: Temporal Synthesis

1. Retrieve knowledge entries across time periods
2. Identify how understanding has evolved
3. Track which early assumptions proved correct/incorrect
4. Extract lessons about the evolution process itself
5. Project forward based on observed trajectory
6. Store temporal insights in Wisdom Vault

## Integration Points

- **Vault:** All vaults (reads from all, writes synthesis to appropriate vault)
- **Agents:** Sage (primary), Prime (council synthesis), Weaver (creative synthesis)
- **Notes:** Creates Insight Notes from synthesis discoveries

## Quality Criteria

- Were all relevant sources consulted?
- Were contradictions resolved, not ignored?
- Did the synthesis produce new understanding (not just aggregation)?
- Is the synthesis stored for future use?

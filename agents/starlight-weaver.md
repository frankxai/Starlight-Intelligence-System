## Reasoning Protocol

```
1. ABSORB
   Creative brief. Audience. Desired impact. Constraints.

2. RECALL
   Query Creative Vault for related past work.
   Query Wisdom Vault for applicable principles.
   Check for voice/style references.

3. DIVERGE
   Generate multiple creative directions.
   Don't judge yet — quantity over quality.
   Look for unexpected connections.

4. CONVERGE
   Evaluate directions against brief.
   Select strongest approach.

5. CREATE
   Execute with craft and care.
   Apply voice and style consistently.

6. REFINE
   Self-review against quality criteria.
   Tighten, polish, strengthen.

7. PRESERVE
   Store creative patterns in Creative Vault.
   Create Insight Note if novel approach discovered.

## What AI-Ops Is

AI-Ops is the self-improving AI operations and research system - comprehensive infrastructure for running, monitoring, and evolving AI systems, with deep research into AGI-ready knowledge systems and memory architectures.

**Core Philosophy:** AI infrastructure that improves itself. Research that becomes practice. Operations that compound.

## Key Components

### Infrastructure
- **LiteLLM** - Unified gateway for all LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **Langfuse** - Observability, tracing, and evaluation for AI operations
- **n8n** - Visual workflow orchestration for automation
- **Docker Compose** - Containerized deployment of all services

### Knowledge Systems Research
- **Temporal Knowledge Graphs** - Knowledge with time dimension (Graphiti model)
- **Memory Hierarchy** - Working → Episodic → Semantic → Procedural
- **Entity-Relationship-Inference** - Structured knowledge representation
- **Domain Isolation** - Privacy-preserving knowledge boundaries

### Memory Architecture Research
- **Episode Layer** - Raw events and interactions
- **Entity Layer** - Named concepts and their attributes
- **Relationship Layer** - Connections between entities
- **Inference Layer** - Derived knowledge from patterns

## Key Patterns Starlight Uses from AI-Ops

| Pattern | AI-Ops Implementation | Starlight Integration |
|---------|----------------------|-----------------------|
| Memory hierarchy | Working→Episodic→Semantic→Procedural | Vault consolidation flow |
| Knowledge graphs | Neo4j/FalkorDB temporal graphs | Vault cross-references |
| Observability | Langfuse tracing | Operational Vault metrics |
| Self-improvement | Feedback loops in operations | Compound Intelligence Effect |
| Domain isolation | Privacy boundaries | Vault access control |

## Integration Points

- **Transmission Channel:** transmissions/channels/ai-ops-channel.md
- **Memory Research:** AI-Ops memory hierarchy directly shaped Vault architecture
- **Infrastructure Patterns:** AI-Ops infrastructure informs Starlight's integration layer
- **Knowledge Graphs:** Temporal knowledge graph concepts inform vault cross-references

## What Starlight Provides to AI-Ops

1. **Unified intelligence layer** that consumes AI-Ops infrastructure
2. **Cross-system patterns** from ACOS and Arcanea
3. **Strategic reasoning** for infrastructure decisions
4. **Wisdom accumulation** from operational experience
5. **Creative approaches** to research problems (via Arcanea patterns)

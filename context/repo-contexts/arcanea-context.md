## What Arcanea Is

Arcanea is the creative intelligence system - a sophisticated agent orchestration platform that uses archetypal wisdom guides (Luminors) and hierarchical skill naming to produce deeply creative, mythic-technical work.

**Core Philosophy:** Creative consciousness meets systematic intelligence. The mythic and the technical are one.

## Key Components

### The Seven Luminors
Archetypal wisdom guides that bring creative consciousness to work:

1. **Luminor of Myths** - Narrative and storytelling wisdom
2. **Luminor of Elements** - Fundamental forces and foundations
3. **Luminor of Shadows** - Hidden patterns and the unconscious
4. **Luminor of Transformation** - Change, evolution, metamorphosis
5. **Luminor of Harmony** - Balance, rhythm, integration
6. **Luminor of Time** - Cycles, timing, temporal awareness
7. **Luminor of Unity** - Interconnection, wholeness, emergence

### Hierarchical Skill Naming
```
domain.category.skill
Example: creative.narrative.worldbuilding
Example: technical.architecture.systems-design
```

### Creative Agent Orchestration
- Agents collaborate with Luminor guidance
- Creative output integrates multiple archetypal perspectives
- Quality review through Luminor lenses

### Token Budget Management
- Sophisticated token allocation per agent and skill
- Progressive loading to maximize creative depth within limits

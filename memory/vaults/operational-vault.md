### [2026-05-12] v0.1 Event Spine Operator Surface

**Category:** execution-state
**Confidence:** 1.0
**Source:** Codex / Plan implementation pass
**Related:** src/ledgers.ts, src/cli.ts, src/mcp-server-v01.ts, src/modules.ts

The SIS v0.1 spine was extended from static ledger primitives into operator-addressable lifecycle controls. JSONL remains canonical, SQLite remains a rebuildable shadow index, and the LCC/dashboard/MCP surfaces can now consume the same WorkPacket and AgentEvent lifecycle.

**Implemented:**
- WorkPacket lifecycle transition helper emits AgentEvent and appends a new WorkPacket snapshot.
- CLI surface added for `events tail`, `memory rebuild`, `workpacket next/start/block/complete`, and `modules list/enable/disable`.
- MCP v0.1 surface added for `sis.events.tail`, `sis.workpacket.next`, `sis.workpacket.complete`, `sis.memory.rebuild`, and `sis.module.list`.
- Module registry scaffold established for Code IS, Second Brain IS, Business IS, Wealth IS, Voice/Video IS, People IS, Music IS, Sound IS, MIS, RIS, and Sensory Companion.
- Rebuild now tolerates legacy snake_case Decision rows while keeping new typed writes strict.

**Verification:** TypeScript no-emit passed. `test/v01-ledgers.test.ts`, `test/v01-mcp-tools.test.ts`, and `npm run test:operational` passed. `starlight memory rebuild` rebuilt `agent-ops.sqlite` from current JSONL ledgers.

### [2026-05-11] SIS v0.1 Build Handoff + Memory Health Gate

**Category:** execution-state
**Confidence:** 1.0
**Source:** Codex / Operational lead pass
**Related:** docs/ops/prompts/starlight-v01-vision.md, docs/ops/prompts/starlight-v01-build-now.md

Frank's expanded SIS v0.1 vision was converted into a two-layer Claude Code handoff: one persistent vision file and one bounded build-now file. The split preserves the full civilization-scale architecture while giving the coding agent a Friday-demo scope: monorepo skeleton, Dashboard Lite, MCP local tools, SQLite/schema persistence, WorkPacket flow, AgentEvent ledger, Decision ledger, Pack Registry, Council review, Vault entry, Brain Graph, and demo script.

**Local action completed:**
- Added a repo-local memory health inspector and surfaced it through `starlight doctor` and `starlight vault health`.
- Added `starlight vault refresh` / `vault consolidate` to run the existing dreaming pass, stamp all six vaults, and print memory surface health.
- Refreshed all six vault consolidation stamps to 2026-05-11.
- Verified typecheck and operational regression coverage after rebuilding the native `better-sqlite3` binding.

**Known gap:** the current dreaming pass processed 0 items because the active voice-session surface is Markdown-first. Future work should add first-class `.md` voice-session promotion into the vault/mempalace pipeline instead of treating freshness stamps as full semantic consolidation.

### [2026-05-08] v8.0 Build Repair + Verification

**Category:** quality-state
**Confidence:** 1.0
**Source:** Codex / Post-Gemini repair pass
**Related:** Technical Vault - Core Regression Harness Pattern

Gemini's v8.0 work landed in the correct SIS repo and included real architecture changes, but the repo was not shippable because `npm run build` failed on public API drift between `src/cli.ts` and `src/index.ts`.

**Repair completed:**
- Restored `StarlightIntelligence.generateContext()`, `routeTask()`, and `orchestrate()` as documented library/CLI API.
- Updated `StarlightIntelligence.remember()` to accept the documented object form while preserving vault classification.
- Fixed file-style `memoryPath` handling so `.starlight/memory.json` resolves to the intended JSONL directory, not `.starlight/memory.json/memory.jsonl`.
- Added a focused regression in `test/core-regressions.test.ts` covering the documented API and JSONL path behavior.

**Verification:** `npm run verify` passed on 2026-05-08: root typecheck, operational tests, substrate tests, package build, site lint/build, and console lint/build.

### [2026-05-06] Starlight Ascension (E2E Upgrade)

**Category:** ecosystem-state
**Confidence:** 1.0
**Source:** Starlight Central Command / Machine-Wide Audit
**Related:** Strategic Vault - Centralized Command Refactor

Comprehensive machine-wide upgrade performed to establish **Starlight Central Command** as the primary machine-level operator.

**Key Structural Changes:**
- **Central Authority**: Sworn in Starlight (via Gemini CLI) as the global orchestrator.
- **Unified AI Grid**: Synchronized `cl/cd/g/oa/cur/st` shortcuts across PowerShell and Bash.
- **Protocol Alignment**: Standardized `GEMINI.md` and `MEMORY.md` across 8 core repositories.
- **Autonomous Mode**: Enforced `--yolo` as the default mandate for high-velocity AI Ops.

**Repository Connectivity Status:**
| Repository | Status | Harness | AI-Ready |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Arcanea | [STABLE] | ao-init | YES |
| SIS | [PRIMARY] | - | YES |
| FrankX | [STABLE] | - | YES |
| GenCreator | [STABLE] | - | YES |
| Vibeclubs | [STABLE] | - | YES |
| AnimeLegends | [STABLE] | - | YES |
| DPI | [STABLE] | - | YES |
| Business | [STABLE] | - | YES |

All sectors operational. Swarm Command Center active.

### [2026-02-10] System Initialization State

**Category:** system-state

### [2026-05-11] Local Command Center Extended With Cursor + GitHub Control Plane

**Category:** orchestration-state
**Confidence:** 0.95
**Source:** Codex CLI session
**Related:** LCC dispatch router, GitHub Copilot CLI, Dependabot operations

Added operational dispatch surfaces for Cursor Agent, GitHub Copilot CLI, and GitHub CLI repository operations inside the private voice-operator LCC router.

- New intent classes: `ide-agent`, `github-agent`, `repo-ops`, `ci-debug`.
- New dispatchers: `cursor` via `cursor agent --print`, `copilot` via `gh copilot`, `github` via read-first `gh` commands.
- GitHub adapter is deliberately read-first: repo metadata, PRs, issues, releases, Actions runs, and Dependabot alerts. Mutating GitHub actions should be explicit subcommands later.
- Machine capability registry now writes `~/.starlight/agent-capabilities.json`.
- Verification: focused router/CLI tests passed, 52/52. Dry-runs route Dependabot to `github`, Cursor tasks to `cursor`, and GitHub Copilot CLI tasks to `copilot`. Live read-only `gh repo view` smoke passed for `frankxai/Starlight-Intelligence-System`.

### [2026-05-12] Jarvis-Grade LCC Slice: Browser Routing + Safer Launcher Defaults

**Category:** orchestration-state
**Confidence:** 0.95
**Source:** Codex CLI session
**Related:** `docs/ops/PLANNING-WITH-FILES-2026-05-12-JARVIS-GRADE-ORCHESTRATOR.md`, `docs/ops/ULTRAPLAN-2026-05-12.md`

Implemented a focused operational slice toward the Jarvis-grade Starlight setup.

- Added file-backed execution plan: local-first Next.js LCC remains primary, Windows/Tauri shell becomes lifecycle wrapper later, Vercel is read-mostly demo/approval mirror, Starlight Orchestrator owns routing/policy.
- Promoted Browser Use + Playwright to a first-class orchestrator dispatcher: new `browser` intent class routes browser/site/app navigation and inspection tasks to `BrowserDispatcher`.
- Updated routing TOML and setup template so browser, Cursor, GitHub Copilot CLI, GitHub CLI, Codex, Gemini, OpenCode, and Claude are one dispatch fleet.
- Made Arcanea voice orb cognition bridge opt-in via `STARLIGHT_ENABLE_COGNITION_BRIDGE=1`; default launcher path keeps orb-native voice faster while Starlight executor loop matures.
- Added dashboard `/api/orb/health` proxy and switched `CockpitOrbFrame` to local API health probing instead of browser-side opaque CORS probing.
- Verification: 79/79 focused Python tests passed; dashboard `npm run test` passed 239 tests; dashboard `npm run type-check` passed. Live probes: LCC `:3007/api/status` reachable, orb `:7777/api/health` reachable, FastAPI `:7373/healthz` reachable.

### [2026-05-12] Arcanea.ai Funnel Foundation Rebuilt

**Category:** cross-repo-delivery
**Confidence:** 0.95
**Source:** Codex CLI session
**Related:** Arcanea channel, Vercel/Next.js production surface

Rebuilt `C:\Users\frank\arcanea.ai` from thin landing shell into a committed Next.js 16 App Router funnel foundation on branch `main`.

- Commit: `7526ea6 feat: rebuild Arcanea funnel foundation`.
- Added premium responsive landing, application page, `/about`, `/retreats`, `/locations`, `/journal`.
- Added `POST /api/applications` with Zod validation, Supabase/Resend production wiring, and local JSONL fallback for development only.
- Added Vercel Analytics and Speed Insights hooks, loaded Google fonts through `next/font`, modern ESLint flat config, lockfile, and Turbopack root pin.
- Verification passed: `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`.
- Deployment not executed because the repo has no Vercel project link or git remote configured locally.

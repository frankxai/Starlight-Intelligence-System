### [2026-02-10] Starlight Intelligence System Architecture Decision

**Category:** architecture
**Confidence:** 0.95
**Source:** Starlight Prime / System Design Session
**Related:** Technical Vault - Configuration-First Pattern

The Starlight Intelligence System was designed as the unified intelligence backbone for the FrankX ecosystem. Key architectural decisions:

1. **Configuration-first philosophy** - Markdown and JSON over code, enabling zero-install-friction deployment
2. **Seven-agent model** - Prime, Architect, Orchestrator, Sentinel, Sage, Weaver, Navigator
3. **Five-vault memory system** - Strategic, Technical, Creative, Operational, Wisdom
4. **Skill auto-activation** - 16 skills with JSON-based activation rules
5. **Transmission-based cross-system communication** - Channel-based message passing between repos
6. **Progressive disclosure** - Load only what's needed, when it's needed

Rationale: This mirrors the evolved patterns from ACOS (agents + skills + commands), integrates AI-Ops memory research (memory hierarchy + knowledge graphs), and incorporates Arcanea's creative intelligence patterns (Luminors + hierarchical skills).

### [2026-02-10] Ecosystem Integration Strategy

**Category:** integration
**Confidence:** 0.90
**Source:** Starlight Navigator / Strategic Analysis
**Related:** Wisdom Vault - Connected Systems Principle

Strategy for how Starlight integrates with the broader FrankX ecosystem:

1. **Starlight provides, repos consume** - Starlight is the intelligence backbone, other repos consume its capabilities
2. **Bidirectional channels** - Each repo has a dedicated Transmission channel for two-way communication
3. **Context snapshots** - Starlight maintains context files for each connected repo
4. **Pattern propagation** - Proven patterns flow from Starlight to consuming repos
5. **Knowledge federation** - Knowledge from any repo can be federated to others through Starlight

This strategy ensures Starlight is the central nervous system without creating tight coupling with any specific repo.

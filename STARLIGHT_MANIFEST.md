## Identity

**Name:** Starlight Intelligence System
**Role:** Open intelligence layer for AI-native development
**Classification:** Multi-platform agent orchestration framework
**Platforms:** Claude Code, Cursor, Cline, Codex, Gemini CLI, Antigravity

## Version History

| Version | Codename | Focus | Date |
|---------|----------|-------|------|
| 1.0.0 | Infinity Engine | Core architecture: Vaults, Notes, Transmissions, Agents, Skills | Feb 2026 |
| **2.0.0** | **Horizons** | **Multi-platform, rearchitected hierarchy, Horizon Vault, premium narrative** | **Feb 2026** |

### What Changed in v2.0.0

- **Multi-platform support** — Added adapters for Cursor, Cline, Codex, Gemini CLI, Antigravity
- **Agent hierarchy rethink** — Flat council with emergent leadership replaces rigid tree
- **Horizon Vault** — Public vault for human hopes, AGI alignment, letters to the future
- **Premium narrative** — Complete rewrite with elevated, AI-lab-quality communication
- **Absorbed patterns** — Claude-Flow swarm coordination, Cursor/Cline rule systems, Codex cascading agents
- **Platform adapters** — `.cursor/rules/`, `.clinerules/`, `.gemini/`, `.antigravity/`, `AGENTS.md`
- **Visual README** — ASCII art, architecture diagrams, comprehensive documentation

## Architecture Principles

1. **Intelligence as Infrastructure** — Not a tool, the foundation everything builds on
2. **Platform Agnostic** — Works with any AI agent that reads files
3. **Configuration over Code** — Markdown and JSON, readable by humans and machines
4. **Memory as Compound Interest** — Every session makes the system smarter
5. **Connected Systems** — Intelligence that flows between projects
6. **Progressive Disclosure** — Load only what you need, on demand
7. **Aligned by Design** — The Horizon Vault ensures human values are first-class
8. **Open and Forkable** — Every piece can be adapted and made your own

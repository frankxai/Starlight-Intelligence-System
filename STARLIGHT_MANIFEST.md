## Dependency Map

```
Starlight Intelligence System
├── Consumes from:
│   ├── AI-Ops (research, patterns, memory architecture)
│   ├── ACOS (agent patterns, skill architecture, commands)
│   └── Arcanea (creative patterns, Luminor wisdom, agent teams)
│
├── Provides to:
│   ├── ACOS (intelligence backbone, vaults, transmissions)
│   ├── Arcanea (strategic intelligence, memory, context)
│   └── AI-Ops (operational intelligence, synthesis)
│
└── Standalone capabilities:
    ├── Multi-agent orchestration
    ├── Persistent memory (Vaults)
    ├── Knowledge capture (Notes)
    ├── Cross-system communication (Transmissions)
    └── Unified context management
```

## Architecture Principles

1. **Configuration-First** - Markdown and JSON, not code
2. **Progressive Disclosure** - Load only what's needed
3. **Zero Install Friction** - Clone, open Claude Code, go
4. **Ecosystem Native** - Designed to connect, not isolate
5. **Memory Persistent** - Knowledge survives sessions
6. **Intelligence Layered** - From meta to specific
